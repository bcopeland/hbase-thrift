Provides an HBase <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/">Thrift</a>
service.

This package contains a Thrift interface definition file for an HBase RPC
service and a Java server implementation.

There is currently 2 thrift server implementations in HBase, the packages:

<ul>
  <li>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift - This may one day be marked as depreceated.</li>
  <li>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift2 - This is intended to closely match to the HTable interface.</li>  
</ul>

<h2><a name="whatisthrift">What is Thrift?</a></h2>

<p>From http://thrift.apache.org/</p> 
  
<p>"Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services 
development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python,
PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk,
and OCaml. Originally developed at Facebook, Thrift was open sourced in April
2007 and entered the Apache Incubator in May, 2008"</p>

<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="generated/THBaseService.Iface.html">HBase API</a> is defined in the
file hbase.thrift. A server-side implementation of the API is in
<code>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift2.ThriftHBaseServiceHandler</code> with the
server boiler plate in <code>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift2.ThriftServer</code>.
The generated interfaces, types, and RPC utility files are checked into SVN under the
<code>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift2.generated</code> directory.

</p>

<p>The files were generated by running the commands:
<pre>
  thrift -strict --gen java src/main/resources/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift2/hbase.thrift
  mv gen-java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift2/generated src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift2/generated
  rm -rf gen-java
</pre>
</p>

<p>The 'thrift' binary is the Thrift compiler, and it is distributed separately from HBase
in a Thrift release. Additionally, specific language runtime libraries are a
part of a Thrift release. A version of the Java runtime is included in HBase via maven.
</p>

<p>To start ThriftServer, use:
<pre>
  ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh start thrift2 [--port=PORT]
</pre>
The default port is 9090.
</p>

<p>To stop, use:
<pre>
  ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop thrift
</pre>
</p>
